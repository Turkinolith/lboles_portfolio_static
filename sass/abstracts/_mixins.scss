////////////////////
In order for the fonts to adjust based on user adjustment in the browser I need to use a relative unit instead of px, em or rem.
Studies show that em tends to be better for this in media queries.
Also keep in mind that in a media query the default value for an em is ALWAYS equal to the font size coming from the browser, or 16px by default.

1em = 16px

Converted into em's the sizes above are:
big-desktop = 112.5
[normal desktop] = 62.5%
tab-land = 75
tab-port = 56.25
phone = 37.5


ORDER: Base + typography > general layout + grid > page layout > components
